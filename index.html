    <p>I am a PhD Fellow in Biomedical Engineering at the <a href="https://en.unipv.it/en">University of Pavia</a>. 
    I am curious about almost everything at the intersection of computer science and healthcare,
    with the goal of improving clinical outcomes and advancing personalized, patient-centered care.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, my research dives into AI-based methodologies for medical image processing and clinical data analysis, 
    with a special focus on cardiovascular diseases. 
    Most of my work revolves around Aortic Dissection, in collaboration with the 
    <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Politecnico di Milano</a> and the ASST Lecco – Cardio Surgery Unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also been lucky enough to collaborate with Professor S. Casarin and Professor E. Dondossola at the 
    <a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/research/">Houston Methodist Research Institute</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/">MD Anderson Cancer Center</a>. 
    Together, we are developing mathematical models to better understand bone metastasis — 
    a research project I joined during my Master’s thesis, supervised by Professor P. Cerveri, who is also my advisor now.
  </p>
   <p>I am also collaborating as a teaching assistant both at University of Pavia and at Politecnico of Milano, 
    with specific support to the Biomedical Instrumentation and Neuroengineering course.
   </p>
   <p>I believe research grows best when ideas are shared. 
    That is why I am always glad to connect with colleagues, exchange knowledge, and build collaborations that bridge disciplines 
    and bring innovation closer to patients :)
   </p>
